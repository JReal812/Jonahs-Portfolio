        <p>Introduction Hello, my name is Jonah. I was born on August 27, 2003, in Miramichi, New Brunswick. Though life has taken me to many places, including New Brunswick and Quebec, my roots are firmly planted in Halifax, where I've spent most of my childhood and adult life.</p>     
            
        <p>Education and Interests While traditional academics like mathematics never piqued my interest, I've always been drawn to technology and operating systems. The limited tech classes available only fueled my curiosity, leading me to explore the vast world of technology on my own. This self-driven exploration has been a cornerstone of my educational journey.</p>
        
        <p>Professional Experience My professional experience has been uniquely shaped by my time as an Uber Eats driver. This job isn't just about delivering food; it's an adventure on the roads, a way to connect with my city, and a rhythm set to the music I love. It has honed my driving skills, teaching me to navigate any situation with ease and confidence.</p>
        
        <p>Gaming and Entertainment Gaming is a significant part of my life. I've transitioned from competitive games like Rainbow Six Siege to a fascination with survival and lesser-known titles, though I still enjoy the occasional match in Fortnite. My love for gaming parallels my appreciation for cinematic masterpieces like Breaking Bad, Peaky Blinders, and Game of Thrones. Their artistry, character development, and stunning visuals resonate deeply with me, reflecting my admiration for the art of storytelling in both games and films.</p>
        
        <p>Social Life Though I consider myself an introvert, my social outings are all about making the most of every moment. When I do step out, I'm all in – partying the night away and enjoying the vibrant energy of downtown Halifax.</p>
        
        <p>Collecting Passions A unique aspect of my personality is my love for collecting Funko Pops. With a collection of around 120 figurines valued at about $2,400, I see it as not just a hobby but an investment. This passion, sparked by a friend, has become a meaningful part of my life.</p>
        
        <p>Future Goals Professionally, my ambition is to land a fulfilling and well-paying tech job. I'm driven by a desire to blend my passion for technology with a career that offers both satisfaction and stability.</p>
        
        <p>Personal Philosophy My life is guided by an unwavering positivity and a commitment to kindness. My dream is to one day establish a charity, using my success to give back and support those in need. This vision for a better world fuels my every step, inspiring me to continually strive for personal and professional growth.</p>
